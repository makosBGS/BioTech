In the sample tube there are now many copies of the DNA region of interest. This region that is amplified is known as the amplicon. After the PCR process the HRM analysis begins. The process is simply a precise warming of the amplicon DNA from around 50 ˚C up to around 95 ˚C. At some point during this process, the melting temperature of the amplicon is reached and the two strands of DNA separate or \"melt\" apart.</p><p style=\"background: none; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><span style=\"color: #3366cc; font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: none; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; border-color: initial; border-image: initial; border-style: initial; font-stretch: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; width: 500px;\"><img alt=\"DNA melting cartoon.jpg\" class=\"image-lazy-loaded\" height=\"176\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/DNA_melting_cartoon.jpg/500px-DNA_melting_cartoon.jpg\" srcset=\"\" style=\"animation: 0.3s ease-in 0s 1 normal none running fadeInImage; background: none; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; height: 176px; line-height: inherit; margin: 0px; max-width: 100%; padding: 0px; vertical-align: middle; width: 500px;\" usemap=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/undefined\" width=\"500\" /></span></span></p><p style=\"background: none; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">The key to HRM is to monitor this separation of strands in real-time. This is achieved by using a fluorescent dye. The dyes that are used for HRM are known as intercalating dyes and have a unique property. They bind specifically to double-stranded DNA and when they are bound they fluoresce brightly. In the absence of double stranded DNA they have nothing to bind to and they only fluoresce at a low level. At the beginning of the HRM analysis there is a high level of fluorescence in the sample because of the billions of copies of the amplicon. But as the sample is heated up and the two strands of the DNA melt apart, presence of double stranded DNA decreases and thus fluorescence is reduced. The HRM machine has a camera that watches this process by measuring the fluorescence. The machine then simply plots this data as a graph known as a melt curve, showing the level of fluorescence vs the temperature:</p><p style=\"background: none; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><span style=\"color: #3366cc; font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: none; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; border-color: initial; border-image: initial; border-style: initial; font-stretch: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; width: 500px;\"><img alt=\"DNA melting scenatic curve.jpg\" class=\"image-lazy-loaded\" height=\"171\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/DNA_melting_scenatic_curve.jpg/500px-DNA_melting_scenatic_curve.jpg\" srcset=\"\" style=\"animation: 0.3s ease-in 0s 1 normal none running fadeInImage; background: none; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; height: 171px; line-height: inherit; margin: 0px; max-width: 100%; padding: 0px; vertical-align: middle; width: 500px;\" usemap=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/undefined\" width=\"500\" /></span></span></p><h3 class=\"in-block\" style=\"background: none; border: 0px; display: table; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.2em; font-stretch: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; line-height: 1.3; margin: 1.5em 0px 0px; overflow-wrap: break-word; padding: 0.5em 0px; vertical-align: baseline; word-break: break-word;\"><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Comparison_of_melt_curves\" style=\"background: none; border: 0px; display: table-cell; font-family: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: middle; width: 348.19px;\">Comparison of melt curves</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\" style=\"background: none; border: 0px; display: table-cell; font-family: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: middle;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: none; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; border-color: initial; border-image: initial; border-radius: 2px; border-style: initial; display: inline-block; flex-basis: 1.25em; font-stretch: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; height: 1.25em; line-height: 0; margin-bottom: -0.75em; margin-right: -0.75em; margin-top: -0.75em; min-height: 1.25em; min-width: 1.25em; overflow: hidden; padding: 0.75em; position: relative; text-overflow: ellipsis; transition-duration: 100ms; transition-property: background-color; vertical-align: middle; white-space: nowrap; width: 1.25em;\">Edit</span></span></span></h3><p style=\"background: none; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">The melting temperature of the amplicon at which the two DNA strands come apart is entirely predictable. It is dependent on the sequence of the DNA bases. If you are comparing two samples from two different people, they should give exactly the same shaped melt curve. However, if one person has a mutation in the DNA region you have amplified, then this will alter the temperature at which the DNA strands melt apart. So now the two melt curves appear different. The difference may only be tiny, perhaps a fraction of a degree, but because the HRM machine has the ability to monitor this process in \"high resolution\", it is possible to accurately document these changes and therefore identify if a mutation is present or not.</p><p style=\"background: none;

More than 400 mutations have been identified in these genes.<br />The sequencing of genes is the gold standard for identifying mutations. Sequencing is time-consuming and labour-intensive and is often preceded by techniques used to identify heteroduplex DNA, which then further amplify these issues. HRM offers a faster and more convenient closed-tube method of assessing the presence of mutations and gives a result which can be further investigated if it is of interest. In a study carried out by Scott et al. in 2006,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\" style=\"background: none; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 0.75em; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant: inherit; line-height: 1; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; unicode-bidi: isolate; white-space: nowrap;\"><span style=\"color: #3366cc; font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: none; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; border-color: initial; border-image: initial; border-style: initial; font-stretch: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit;\">[4]</span></span></sup>&nbsp;3 cell lines harbouring different BRCA mutations were used to assess the HRM methodology. It was found that the melting profiles of the resulting PCR products could be used to distinguish the presence or absence of a mutation in the amplicon. Similarly in 2007 Krypuy et al.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\" style=\"background: none; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 0.75em; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant: inherit; line-height: 1; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; unicode-bidi: isolate; white-space: nowrap;\"><span style=\"color: #3366cc; font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: none; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; border-color: initial; border-image: initial; border-style: initial; font-stretch: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit;\">[5]</span></span></sup>&nbsp;showed that the careful design of HRM assays (with regards to primer placement) could be successfully employed to detect mutations in the TP53 gene, which encodes the tumour suppressor protein p53 in clinical samples of breast and ovarian cancer. Both these studies highlighted the fact that changes in the melting profile can be in the form of a shift in the melting temperature or an obvious difference in the shape of the melt curve. Both of these parameters are a function of the amplicon sequence. The consensus is that HRM is a cost efficient method that can be employed as an initial screen for samples suspected of harbouring polymorphisms or mutations. This would reduce the number of samples which need to be investigated further using more conventional methods.</p><h3 class=\"in-block\" style=\"background: none; border: 0px; display: table; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.2em; font-stretch: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; line-height: 1.3; margin: 1.5em 0px 0px; overflow-wrap: break-word; padding: 0.5em 0px; vertical-align: baseline; word-break: break-word;\"><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Zygosity_testing\" style=\"background: none; border: 0px; display: table-cell; font-family: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: middle; width: 348.19px;\">Zygosity testing</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\" style=\"background: none; border: 0px; display: table-cell; font-family: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: middle;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: none; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; border-color: initial; border-image: initial; border-radius: 2px; border-style: initial; display: inline-block; flex-basis: 1.25em; font-stretch: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; height: 1.25em; line-height: 0; margin-bottom: -0.75em; margin-right: -0.75em; margin-top: -0.75em; min-height: 1.25em; min-width: 1.25em; overflow: hidden; padding: 0.75em; position: relative; text-overflow: ellipsis; transition-duration: 100ms; transition-property: background-color; vertical-align: middle; white-space: nowrap; width: 1.25em;\">Edit</span></span></span></h3><p style=\"background: none; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Currently there are many methods used to determine the&nbsp;<span style=\"color: #3366cc; font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: none; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; border-color: initial; border-image: initial; border-style: initial; font-stretch: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit;\">zygosity</span></span>&nbsp;status of a gene at a particular locus. These methods include the use of PCR with specifically designed probes to detect the variants of the genes (SNP typing is the simplest case). In cases where longer stretches of variation is implicated, post PCR analysis of the amplicons may be required. Changes in enzyme restriction, electrophoretic and chromatographic profiles can be measured. These methods are usually more time-consuming and increase the risk of amplicon contamination in the laboratory, due to the need to work with high concentrations of amplicons in the lab post-PCR. The use of HRM reduces the time required for analysis and the risk of contamination.
